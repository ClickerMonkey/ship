# Course: Algorithms

- [x] Documented

This project contains solutions to multiple chapters of the algorithms book.

- Anagrams [link](src/chapter1/project/Anagrams.java)
	- Given a set of words, find all anagram matches.
	- A hashtable, tree, and brute-force implementations were done.
- Sorting Algorithms
	- Compare the runtime of various sorting algoriths with each other against already sorted, sorted in reverse, and randomly ordered arrays. [link](src/chapter2/sorting/Statistics.java)
	- Sorts: Binary Insertion, Bubble, Heap, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Selection, Shell
	- Individual shell sort comparision and stability test [link](src/chapter5/ShellSort.java)
	- Individual heap tests [link](src/chapter6/Heap.java)
- Clique Detection in a graph [link](src/chapter3/Clique.java)
- Calculate Hamiltonian circuit from a random number of graph points [link](src/chapter3/HamiltonCircuit.java)
- Closest Pair [link](src/chapter4/ClosestPair.java)
	- Compare the runtime of an algorithm against brute force.
- Horspools text searching [link](src/chapter7/Horspool.java)
- Binary Space Partitioning Tree (BSP Tree)
	- Visualize an environment where walls are lines added to a BSP tree and can be used to determine which walls are visible based on the "eye" (mouse) [link](src/finalproject/BSPScreen.java)
	- Build your own BSP Tree level [link](src/finalproject/LevelEditor.java)
		- C adds a line - use mouse to drag end points.
		- Press 1 - 9 to save your work to a level to use in the following animation.
	- Insertion Animation [link](src/finalproject/animation/InsertionAnimation.java)
		- Press a key 1-5 to load a level and watch the BSP tree build
